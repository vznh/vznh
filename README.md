# 👋 
I'm an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz with a primary in both Computer Science and Applied Math. Ex-Apple, Ex-startup, and will-be in NYC.

- So far, I contributed to: [Repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix), [Ghostfolio](https://github.com/ghostfolio/ghostfolio)

- ⚙️ I use `.ts`, `.tsx` for my startups/side projects. 

- 🔎 I use `.py`, `.c`, `.rs` for any of my research.

- I don't work on side projects during weekends.
