# 👋 
I'm an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz with a primary in both Computer Science and Biology, concentrating in software engineering and neuroscience.  

- Current: integration testing my life rn

- I have software engineering experience at both FAANG and startup.

- I was previously Research@Carnegie Mellon (Neuro), Research@UC Santa Cruz (GenAI), and Research@Seoul National (Genome R&D).

- ⚙️ I use `.ts`, `.tsx` for my startups. 

- 💼 I use `.m`, `.swift`, `.cpp` for my work. 

- 🔎 I use `.py`, `.c`, `.rs` for any of my research.

- 🧑‍🎓 I'm delving more into open-source contribution so I can adapt to different types of codebases.

- 📝 Large gap in my contributions? I was most likely working in a private repo for an internship, or studying for examinations.
