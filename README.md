# 👋 
I'm an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz with a primary in both Computer Science and Biology, concentrating in software engineering and neuroscience.  

- Right now, I'm working on [Polyglot](https://landing-lime-five.vercel.app/) at Stanford.  

- I was a founder for [Tokn](https://tokn.so), which was acquired by Birdeye in February 2024. 

- I was an Software Engineering Intern one of the FAANGs.

- I was previously Research@Carnegie Mellon (Neuro), Research@UC Santa Cruz (GenAI), and Research@Seoul National (Genome R&D).

- ⚙️ I use `.ts`, `.tsx` for my startups. 

- 💼 I use `.m`, `.swift`, `.cpp` for my work. 

- 🔎 I use `.py`, `.c`, `.rs` for any of my research.

- 🧑‍🎓 I'm delving more in-depth in `.rs` as of right now to explore quantitative development.
